## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

**Warning:** The installation script will back up your existing configuration files (like `.zshrc`, `.tmux.conf`, etc.) to a `~/.dotfiles_backup_...` directory before creating new ones.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2.  **Run the installation script:**
    The script will automatically create symbolic links for the configuration files.
    ```bash
    # Make sure the script is executable
    chmod +x install.sh

    # Run the installer
    ./install.sh
    ```

3.  **Restart your shell:**
    To apply all changes, close and reopen your terminal, or run:
    ```bash
    source ~/.zshrc
    ```

## üîß Customization

All configuration files are located in the `configs/` directory. You can modify them directly to suit your needs. After making changes, you don't need to run the installer again as they are symbolically linked.
