## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

**Warning:** The installation script will back up your existing configuration files (like `.zshrc`, `.tmux.conf`, etc.) to a `~/.dotfiles_backup_...` directory before creating new ones.

1.  **Clone the repository into the `goinfre` folder:**
    ```bash
    cd ~/goinfre && \
    git clone git@github.com:miniminjae92/42env-linux.git
    ```

2.  **Run the installation script:**
    The script will automatically create symbolic links for the configuration files.
    ```bash
    cd 42env-linux/gs42/scripts && \
    chmod +x setup.sh && \
    ./setup.sh
    ```

3.  **Restart your shell:**

## ü§ñ Using the Gemini CLI

To use the Gemini CLI with this environment, follow these steps:

1.  Create a file named `.gemini.env` in your **home directory (`~`)**.
2.  Add your API key to this file like so:
    ```
    export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-api-key"
    export GEMINI_API_KEY="$GOOGLE_API_KEY"
    ```
3.  The `~/.zshrc` configuration will automatically load this key and set it as an environment variable for you. If you prefer to store this file in a different location, you can modify the `if [ -f "$HOME/.gemini.env" ]` line in your `.zshrc` to match the new path. If your `node` binary path is different, please update the `export PATH` line in `~/.zshrc` to match your path.

* Press **F1** to automatically insert the 42 header at the top of your file.
* Press **Space + f** to format your code to comply with Norminette standards.

## üîß Customization

All configuration files are located in the `configs/` directory. You can modify them directly to suit your needs. After making changes, you don't need to run the installer again as they are symbolically linked.
